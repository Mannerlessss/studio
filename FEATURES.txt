# VaultBoost Application Features

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the features available in the User Panel, Admin Panel, and the Login/Authentication system based on the project's codebase.

### 1. Login & Authentication

The authentication system is the entry point for your users, designed to be secure and straightforward.

-   **Unified Login/Signup Page (`/app/login/page.tsx`):**
    -   A single, user-friendly page featuring two tabs: **Login** and **Sign Up**.
    -   **Login:** Existing users can securely log in using their email and password. The interface provides immediate feedback on success or failure.
    -   **Sign Up:** New users can create an account by providing their Full Name, Email, Phone Number, and a Password. It also includes an optional field for a **Referral Code** to track user acquisition channels.

-   **Authentication Context (`/src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`):**
    -   This is the technical core of the user-facing application's authentication. It's built to manage the user's login state seamlessly using Firebase Authentication.
    -   It is currently configured to use mock data, which allows developers to bypass the login screen and work on the application as if they were a logged-in user, speeding up development and testing.

This is the main, feature-rich interface for your users after they log in.

    -   **Transaction History:** A comprehensive list of all financial activities (investments, earnings, bonuses, withdrawals). The list can be filtered by transaction type for easy tracking.

-   **Referral Page (`/app/refer/page.tsx`):**

    -   **Manage Codes:** Displays a table of all existing offer codes with their current status (Active/Expired) and usage count. Admins can also copy a code for distribution or delete it from this table.
